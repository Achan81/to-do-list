## Overview:
A side project To-Do-List App made with React. 

## Deployment:
This app has been deployed on Netlify and can be found [**here**](https://achan81-todolist.netlify.app/ "here")

## Brief:
* revisit GA SEI previous module to refresh understanding of React and JavaScript
* Ensure basic functionality works
* Style the App so that it can be used on Computer screen or Mobile
* Design and deploy the App so it can actually be used and not be just a concept project


## Technologies used:
HTML | CSS | Bootstrap | JavaScript | React | UUID | Darkmode.js


## Getting Started:
Use the clone button to download the app source code. 

## Using NPM
`npm run start` or `npm run dev`  to run the development server
`npm run build` to create a build directory

## Using Yarn
`yarn start` or `yarn dev`  to run the development server
`yarn build` to create a build directory

### ⚠️
To prevent the `failed-to-compile` issue for linter errors like `no-unsed-vars`, rename the `.env.example` to `.env` and restart your development server. Note this will only change the behaviour of certain linter errors to now be warnings, and is added just to allow your code to compile in development. These errors should still be fixed and other errors will still result in the code being unable to compile

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### key learnings
* how to build a to-do-list
* Understanding the importance of UUID
* Understanding the when to use 'index.html' on single page Apps.
* Constant testing of final App on various modes and browsers.
* Customising darkmode to selectively affect or not affect things. (i.e images)
* A mobile responsive app
* local storage used to store current task & mode

### UUID 
- A universally unique identifier (UUID) is a 128-bit format for creating IDs in code that has become popular in recent years, especially in relation to database keys. By using UUIDs, you ensure that your ID is not just unique in the context of a single database table or web application, but is truly unique in the universe. 
- All UUIDs are 128 bits in length, but are commonly represented as 32 hexadecimal characters separated by four hyphens.
- This app uses Version 4 UUIDs.
- It is important to note that while the probability that a UUID will collide with another is not zero, its practically zero. The chances of collision are so astronomically low, worrying about it would be ridiculous. The total number of possible UUIDs is ```2^128``` or ```340282366920938463463374607431768211456.```

## Future Content and Improvements:
* Edit task?
* Additional Task Pages so that user can split task types.. i.e todolist for work, todolist for shopping, todolist for event planning.
